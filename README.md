> This app was built to showcase the skills I have learnt from [the tutorial by TheNetNinja](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9iJ_KkrkBZWZRHVwnzLIoUE)

 - This is a tool management CRUD (Create, Read, Edit, Delete) application built using the MERN stack (Mongo DB, Express.js, React.js and Node.js). 
 - All tools I used throughout the project are displayed on the home page. From there you can create or delete tools after signing up for an account or logging in as guest.
 - *(For demo reasons, **Edits and Deletes are not registered** to the database)* 


## How to start the app

Visit [my website](https://nicholasyan.site/) to view the project in production. 

Or, to run the project, clone this repository into an empty directory. Then start a new MongoDB database and create a new tool collection.

Once this is done, go into the /backend folder and run:

1. `npm install` 
2. `node server.js` 

The backend should now be running on port 4000 and MongoDB should be connected 

After the backend is running, go into the frontend folder and run:

1. `npm install` 
2. `npm start` 

This should launch the React application frontend on: http://localhost:3000
